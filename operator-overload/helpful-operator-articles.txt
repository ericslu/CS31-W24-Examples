NOTE: If you search online for articles on Overloading Operators in C++, you will discover that there are many approaches to overloading an Operator in C++. Some approaches have 1 parameter in the operator overload function, while so far from what I have seen in this course (Discussion Slides and Lectures), Professor Stahl has covered the alternative approach with 2 parameters in the operator overload function. 

The following articles will focus on Operator Overloads using 2 parameters.
