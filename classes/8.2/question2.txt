2. Write a class Person that has two private data members: 
• m_age(an int)
• m_nickname(a string).

The Person class should have a default constructor that initializes its member variables to reasonable values and a second constructor that initializes the member variables to the values of its parameters. In addition, Person should have three public member functions:
• getAge(), which returns the Person’s age
• haveBirthday(), which increments the Person’s age by 1 
• speak(), which prints the Person’s nickname.
