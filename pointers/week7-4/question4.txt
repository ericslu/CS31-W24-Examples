This question covers edge cases to consider in processing C Strings.

4) Consider the following function that loops through the characters of a C-string and prints them one by one. What are some possible inputs to the function that could break it?

void printChars(const char* str) {
    int i = 0;
    while (*(str + i) != '\0') {
        cout << *(str + i) << endl;
        i++;
    }
}
